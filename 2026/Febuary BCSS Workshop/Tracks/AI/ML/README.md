# AI/ML Object Detection Introduction

This project provides a comprehensive introduction to key topics in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) related to object detection and classification. The primary focus is on understanding the fundamental concepts and techniques that enable machines to identify and classify objects within images or video streams.

# Tasks
- You can follow along with the intro-to-object-detection notebook.

- Or you can build, run and validate your own object detection classifier using the dataset provided in the Dataset folder, note the data is annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.
