    "## 1. Bottleneck Analysis\n",
    "What potential bottlenecks do you see in our design? Consider:\n",
    "- Network bandwidth and latency\n",
    "- Processing power on the ROV vs. surface station\n",
    "- Data storage and transmission\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Multi-ROV Scalability\n",
    "If you had to handle multiple ROVs at once, what might need to change about our design?\n",
    "- How would you manage multiple video streams?\n",
    "- What changes to the UI/UX would be needed?\n",
    "- What changes to data storage might be needed ?\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Autonomous Operation\n",
    "If our ROV was automated, how might you change the design?\n",
    "- What new components would you add?\n",
    "- How would autonomous decision-making integrate with the current architecture?\n",
    "- What role would the surface station play?\n",
    "- How would you handle fail-safes and emergency override?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Fault Tolerance & Reliability\n",
    "What happens when things go wrong?\n",
    "- How would you handle the broker going down ?\n",
    "- How would you handle losing connection to the ROV ?\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Data Management Strategy\n",
    "How would you handle the massive amounts of data an ROV generates?\n",
    "- Real-time vs. recorded data - what gets stored where?\n",
    "- How long should mission data be retained?\n",
    "- What metadata is important to capture?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Security & Access Control\n",
    "Who should be able to control the ROV and access its data?\n",
    "- How would you implement authentication?\n",
    "- What permission levels make sense?\n",
    "- How do you secure the communication channel?\n",
    "- What about physical security of the equipment?\n",
